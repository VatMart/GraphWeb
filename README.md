GraphWeb â€” App for visualization of Graphs and Algorithms
=============
![GraphWeb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a116d62-f3bd-4d17-96d9-08346b2d79c9)

# Description
The application provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and analyzing
graphs. Users can create graphs in several ways; customize the appearanceof the graph.
The application also provides a set of algorithms that can be applied to the graph.

The goal of GraphWeb is to simplify the process of graph and algorithms visualization
and manipulation for users ranging from students and educators to researchers and
developers. The application provides a comprehensive platform for graph creation and
analysis, enabling users to visualize and understand graph structures with ease.

**See official site [graphweb.io](https://graphweb.io) for a live demonstration**

# Features

- **Graph Visualization:** Dynamic and interactive graph visualizations.
- **Graph Creation:** Create graphs using various methods: generation from options, manual drawing, importing from different inputs.
- **Graph Customization:** Modify graph styles, colors, and layouts.
- **Force Layout:** Automatically arrange graphs for optimal readability.
- **Algorithm Visualization:** Animate and visualize graph algorithms with step-by-step playback.
- **Export as PNG:** Save graphs as PNG images.
- **Export Graph Data:** Export graphs as matrices or sets of vertices and edges.
- **Export Graph Output:** See generated matrices/sets of built graph and export them as text.

**GraphWeb adopted for desktops and mobile devices**
